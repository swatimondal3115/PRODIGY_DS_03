# PRODIGY_DS_03

## Decision Tree Classifier for Term Deposit Subscription Prediction:
This project involves building a Decision Tree classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and behavioral data. The dataset used for this analysis is the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### Files:
PRODIGY_DS_03.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with the code for data preprocessing, model building, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

#### Data Source:
The analysis is based on data sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

##### Project Overview:
In this project, I build a Decision Tree classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit. The process involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Model Building: Constructing a Decision Tree classifier.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the model parameters to improve performance.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model using precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.

###### Key Findings:
Data Preprocessing: Effective preprocessing significantly improves model accuracy.

Model Performance: The Decision Tree classifier shows good performance in predicting term deposit subscriptions.

Evaluation Metrics: Precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix are essential for assessing model performance.
